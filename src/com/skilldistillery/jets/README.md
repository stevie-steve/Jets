# Jets Homework Assignment

### Overview

The user is greeted with a welcome message and a menu of options as follows:
1. List fleet
2. Fly all jets
3. View fastest jet
4. View jet with longest range
5. Load all Cargo Jets
6. Dogfight!
7. Add a jet to Fleet
8. Remove a jet from Fleet
9. Quit 

Determining which option the user decides, the program will run that command and return immediately to the main menu.  The program is able to run any option in any order, and be able to update the information accordingly. For example, if a user chooses option "1. List fleet", a list of 5 pre-coded jets will appear. If the user then chooses option "7. Add a jet to Fleet" and/or option "8. Remove a jet from Fleet", that newly added user input will properly generate an updated list when "1. List fleet" is called. Same concept applies to Option "3. View Fastest Jet" and "4. View Jet with longest range" in that the newly added jets will be considered when populating that return.  The program will continue to run until the user chooses "9. Quit". There are two Types of jets pre-coded into the program: FighterJet and CargoCarrier.  The program will properly display whch jet is called when options 5 and 6 are called.  The user has the option to add more jets with option 7. These jets are only permitted to be of a new Type Passenger.

### Lessons Learned
1. Each file, assignment and experience does not exist in a bubble.  Remember your past work and be able to apply those learnings to new material.  I was able to pull large chunks of code from multiple different assignments and alter to fit the need of this assignment.  At first I was concerned that this was a bit of a "cheat" for myself in that I was not creating the code from scratch, but I realized that I identified the similarity, tracked down the information, and manipulated it to my needs.  This showed I knew more than I previously believed I knew. 
2. I created multiple files to "test" with.  Concerned with inserting blocks of code into my project, i often had a "Testing" class file that I would use. This file was basically an electronic scratch piece of paper where I would run small parts of code and try to work out bugs before inputting into my actual assignment. This proved very helpful as my actual assignment files became longer and I often missed occurences like auto-imports that populated from other cut/paste codes and the ever present curly brace equilibrium issue. 
3. Be very descriptive in naming conventions.  As I continue to try my best with proper case conventions, I have become more aware of the importance of descriptive naming.  That whole CIRMOThaW statement (Yeah, i made that up, use it). I was able to follow my own code more easily and debug quicker when being overly descriptive in creating names for variables, classes and methods.
